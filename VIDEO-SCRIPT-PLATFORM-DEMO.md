### INTRO (0:00 - 1:30)

**[VISUAL: Animation or title card]**

**NARRATION:**

*"Revolution in a cup. In this demonstration, we'll show you how Chai Project is transforming the coffee industry using blockchain technology.*

*Perhaps you think the coffee supply chain is simple: farmers grow beans, roasters process them, and you enjoy your coffee. Everyone gets a fair share. Right?*

*However, this is what actually happens: Over the last decades, the price of your coffee went up dramatically. But did you know that only about 4% of the money we spend on coffee reaches the coffee farmer? And while prices went up for you, for the people growing and picking your coffee, they went down.*

*How is this possible? For a very long time, the value in the global coffee chain was more or less equally divided between producing and consuming countries. This changed rapidly over the last decades to a point where nowadays only 15% of the coffee value remains in coffee-producing countries.*

*Over the last three decades, the global coffee chain became dominated by only five large multinationals. They pushed prices up for consumers while squeezing out all value-adding activities in coffee-growing countries, leaving them dependent on development aid.*

*Can we do something about this? Yes. With your help, we can make a change.*

*Chai Project decided to go back to where it all started: the birthplace of coffee. We're partnering with coffee milling and roasting factories in Kenya, expanding to Ethiopia and Uganda, where we tokenize rigorously verified coffee groves on the blockchain.*

*This is what we call a revolution in a cup. Let me show you how it works."*
