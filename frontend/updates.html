            <h2 class="update-title">Strategic Partnership with Ritho FCS Ltd</h2>
            <div class="update-content">
                <p>We're excited to announce a major milestone in our journey: a strategic collaboration with <strong>Ritho FCS Ltd</strong>, a cooperative society that mills and roasts coffee. This partnership represents a critical step forward in ensuring our pilot farmers receive timely payments and fair market prices for their coffee beans.</p>

                <p>Through this collaboration, Ritho FCS Ltd will provide essential milling, roasting, and market access services to our 200 pilot farmers, ensuring that coffee beans are processed and sold at optimal times to maximize returns. This partnership addresses one of the biggest challenges smallholder farmers face: accessing reliable processing facilities and receiving prompt payment.</p>

                <div class="partnership-details">
                    <h3>What This Means for Our Farmers</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Timely Payments:</strong> Farmers will receive payment within days of harvest, not weeks or months. This cash flow improvement is critical for families who depend on harvest income.</li>
                        <li><strong>Professional Milling:</strong> Access to Ritho FCS's cooperative milling facilities ensures consistent quality processing of coffee beans.</li>
                        <li><strong>Roasting Services:</strong> Farmers can access value-added roasting services, potentially increasing their income by selling processed coffee instead of raw beans.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fair Market Prices:</strong> As a cooperative society, Ritho FCS ensures farmers receive competitive prices based on quality and current market conditions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quality Standards:</strong> Professional grading and quality assessment help farmers understand and improve their product quality.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cooperative Benefits:</strong> Being part of a cooperative structure means farmers have a voice in operations and share in the value created through processing.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>This partnership is particularly significant for our <span class="highlight-text">200 pilot farmers</span> who are testing our tokenization platform. By ensuring reliable market access and prompt payment, we're removing one of the biggest barriers to farmer participation in our program.</p>

                <p><strong>Why This Partnership Matters:</strong> Traditional agricultural supply chains often leave farmers waiting months for payment while middlemen capture most of the value. Our collaboration with Ritho FCS, a cooperative society, disrupts this pattern by providing direct access to milling and roasting facilities with transparent pricing and rapid payment cycles.</p>

                <p>The partnership also validates our platform's approach. Ritho FCS recognizes that well-supported, fairly-paid farmers produce higher quality crops and more reliable supply. As a cooperative, they share our values of farmer empowerment and fair value distribution. This alignment of incentives benefits everyone: farmers earn more, the cooperative receives better quality beans, and our platform demonstrates its value proposition.</p>

                <p><strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> This collaboration with Ritho FCS is just the beginning. As we scale from 200 pilot farmers to 2,000+ tokenized groves by Q2 2026, partnerships with cooperatives like Ritho FCS will be essential. We're proving that agricultural tokenization isn't just about technology—it's about building an ecosystem of partners committed to farmer prosperity.</p>

                <p class="highlight-text">Together with Ritho FCS cooperative society, we're not just changing how farmers access capital—we're transforming the entire agricultural value chain to work for farmers, not against them.</p>

            <h2 class="update-title">Platform Launch & Token Sales</h2>
            <div class="update-content">
                <p>We're preparing for our official platform launch in <strong>Q2 2026</strong>. This will mark the beginning of public token sales, allowing investors worldwide to participate in agricultural tokenization.</p>

                <p>Our pilot program with 200 farmers is providing valuable insights that will ensure a smooth, successful launch. By Q2 2026, we aim to have 2,000+ tokenized groves on the platform.</p>

                <p>Stay tuned for more updates as we approach this exciting milestone.</p>
